# BookStore React-Redux Project

> The Bookstore is a website similar to the ["Awesome Books" I built with JavaScript](https://dansam5k.github.io/Awesome-Books/). In this project I was able to accomplished the following with react, react-redux:
- Display a list of books.
- Add a book.
- Remove a selected book.
- By building this application, I learn how to use React and Redux and much more.

> I was also able to connect Redux with an API - the [Bookstore API](https://www.notion.so/Bookstore-API-51ea269061f849118c65c0a53e88a739).
> Finally, after building the Bookstore website functionality, I was able to add styling, using [Zeplin](https://app.zeplin.io/login) as a collaboration tool.
